NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python and is widely used in machine learning as it provides powerful functions and libraries for data manipulation, computation and visualization.

Here are some of the key features of NumPy that machine learning engineers should know:

1. **ndarray**: NumPy's main object is the homogeneous multi-dimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy, dimensions are called axes. The number of axes is rank.

2. **Array operations**: NumPy provides a large collection of mathematical functions that can be applied to arrays, such as mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, etc.

3. **Broadcasting**: Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism that allows numpy to work with arrays of different shapes when performing arithmetic operations. The smaller array is broadcast to the size of the larger array so that they have compatible shapes.

4. **Linear algebra**: NumPy has a built-in module for linear algebra, which provides functions for matrix operations like matrix multiplication, inversion, determinant calculation, eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations, etc.

5. **Indexing and slicing**: NumPy arrays can be indexed and sliced like lists and other sequences in Python. This allows for easy manipulation and selection of subsets of data.

6. **Memory efficiency**: NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient than Python lists because they use a single block of memory, whereas lists use a separate block for each element.

7. **Interoperability**: NumPy arrays can easily be converted to and from other data types and formats such as pandas DataFrames, and can also be used with other libraries such as SciPy and Matplotlib for further data manipulation and visualization.

8. **Speed**: NumPy is implemented in C and it is a faster than regular Python Lists. This is especially important when working with large datasets.

These are some of the most important features of NumPy that machine learning engineers should know. Understanding these features allows you to use NumPy to effectively manipulate, compute, and visualize data, which are essential tasks in the field of machine learning.
