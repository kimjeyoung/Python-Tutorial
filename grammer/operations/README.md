
In Python, you can perform arithmetic operations using the standard mathematical operators:

* **Addition**: The '+' operator is used to add two or more numbers. For example: 2 + 3 will return 5.

* **Subtraction**: The '-' operator is used to subtract one number from another. For example: 5 - 2 will return 3.

* **Multiplication**: The '*' operator is used to multiply two or more numbers. For example: 3 * 4 will return 12.

* **Division**: The '/' operator is used to divide one number by another. For example: 8 / 2 will return 4.0. In python3, the / operator returns the float quotient.

* **Floor Division**: The '//' operator is used to divide one number by another and return the integer quotient. It discards the fractional part. For example: 8 // 3 will return 2.

* **Modulus (remainder)**: The '%' operator is used to return the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example: 8 % 3 will return 2.

* **Exponentiation**: The '**' operator is used to raise a number to a power. For example: 2 ** 3 will return 8.


In addition to these basic arithmetic operations, Python also provides a number of built-in functions and modules for more advanced mathematical operations. For example, you can use the **math** module to perform trigonometric, logarithmic, and other advanced calculations.
You can also use the **numpy library** for mathematical and scientific computing in python, which provides a wide range of mathematical functions, including linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and statistical functions.
It is also worth noting that python supports arithmetic operation between different data types such as integers, float, and complex numbers.

```python
>>> 2 + 3.5
5.5
>>> 2 + 3j
(2+3j)
```
